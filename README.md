# University-Timetable-Scheduling-with-Genetic-Algorithms
This project aimed to develop an AI-based solution to the complex university timetable scheduling problem, using genetic algorithms to ensure efficient allocation of resources while minimizing schedule clashes.
Develop an AI-based solution to the complex university timetable scheduling problem, using genetic algorithms to ensure efficient allocation of resources while minimizing schedule clashes. The solution adhered to hard and soft constraints, such as room capacity, professor availability, and course scheduling, while optimizing fitness through the genetic algorithm approach.
